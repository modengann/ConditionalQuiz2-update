/** Task:
 *  1. Write code that will take in two separate values from the user.
 *  2. Write code that will accurately produce one of the following statements based on the given inputs from Step #1:
 *       "Both numbers were divisible by 3!"
 *       "Only one of the numbers was divisble by 3"
 *       "Neither number was divisible by 3"
 *  3. Your code should work for any input value.
 * 
 *  For example:
 *    With inputs of 6 and 3, the output should be: "Both numbers were divisible by 3!"
 *    With inputs of 6 and 4, the output should be: "Only one of the numbers was divisble by 3"
 *    With inputs of 4 and 2, the output should be: "Neither number was divisible by 3"
